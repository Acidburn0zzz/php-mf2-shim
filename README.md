php-mf2-shim
============

A parsing library for parsing pages from a few common non-mf2 sites into the mf2 structure.

Currently basic Twitter tweet permalink parsing is implemented, including author and reply tweets. Check the tests to see exactly what is handled, usage instructions will arrive once the API is a little more stable and weâ€™ve started using the shim on our own sites.
